 <h3>S3662687</h3>
 <p>Hello! Welcome to my profile<p>
<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
 <h2>INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY</h2>
  <p>I've developed a interested during the latter half of my life. 
   I've have been playing video games since the age of 6 which lead
   to an interest in video game developement and programming.
 </p>
 <h2>EDUCATION</h2>
 <p>I've completed my VCE in 2016 and successfully completed my Diploma of Business at RMIT in 2018 and currently 
  I'm studying IT at RMIT. I chose to study at RMIT because it was easy to travel to and that i've heard good things
  about the university. </p>
 <h2>PERSONAL INFORMATION<h2>
<h1>PERONAL PROFILE<h1>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
 <li>Myer-Briggs test</li>
 <li>Learning style test</li>
 <li>Personality test</li>
 </ul>
 
<p>Based on the results im a introvert person who likes to think alot and enjoy variety in my works. 
 this probably means that i work better in amall but diverse group of people. By having a diverse group of people will allow more creative way of thiunking.
 My prefered learning style is visual with hand-on learning being a close second,
 i would work much better with poeple of similar style than those of auditory learning style and that fact that i have trouble 
 communicating with new poeple makes it much harder.
